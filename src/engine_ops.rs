//! Shared engine operations callable by BOTH the HTTP handlers (`server.rs`) and
//! the `bench-query` CLI, so the two never drift.
//!
//! WHY: "Remove Index" and the query pipeline have non-trivial, correctness-
//! critical bodies (atomic generation-bump persistence, optional LLM client
//! construction, repo normalization). The CLI must run the EXACT same logic the
//! server runs. These fns take the individual shared handles (not `AppState`) so
//! the CLI can call them without constructing an axum `State`. The server's
//! handlers are thin wrappers that translate the result into HTTP responses.

///    then memory, BEFORE touching the old directory. Persisting the bump first
///    guarantees a concurrent re-index resolves the NEW (pristine) generation and
///    opens immediately instead of parking behind the slow lock-drain.
/// 4. Remove the OLD generation's directory WITHOUT the open gate (the durable
///    bump means nothing can race or recreate it).
