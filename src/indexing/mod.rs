/// graph/stats cache recompute is an O(repo) full-table GROUP BY that does NOT
/// cooperatively yield (~90s at kernel scale). If it fires on EVERY index
/// completion — as it used to — an edit burst (user saves N files → N
/// completions) runs it back-to-back, permanently pinning the one connection so
/// every incremental's own queries stall behind it. Detaching it onto a
/// `tokio::spawn` frees the consumer TASK but NOT the CONNECTION.
///
/// The fix is to DEFER the recompute until the repo has gone quiet: we only run
/// it after no new completion has arrived for this window. Long enough to absorb
/// a save burst, short enough the cache isn't very stale. The `/graph` and
/// `/index-stats` serve paths each have a cold-miss fallback that recomputes
/// on-demand, so a request landing in the gap before the deferred recompute is
/// still correct (just pays the one-off aggregation itself).
///
/// CONSIDERED-AND-REJECTED: *cancelling* an in-flight recompute on a new trigger
/// does NOT reliably free the connection — the ~90s GROUP BY is a single
/// non-yielding RocksDB call, so a `CancellationToken` can only take effect
/// BETWEEN the graph query and the stats query, never mid-query. Debounce (defer
/// until quiet) sidesteps the contention entirely instead of racing it. Making
/// the aggregation itself incremental (O(changed)) is the long-term ideal but is
/// a much larger change (the graph cache is a global degree-ranked hub subgraph,
