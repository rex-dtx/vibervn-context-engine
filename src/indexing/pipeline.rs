// the FINAL content from scratch (full rebuild) and snapshot its `calls` set,
// then build the INITIAL content, full-rebuild it, and replay the edit through
// the SAME DB-level sequence `incremental_run` uses (capture old surface →
// incremental delete → re-write changed symbols/raw_edges → compute surface
// delta → gated direction-1 query → resolve_edges_incremental). The two `calls`
// sets MUST be EQUAL (order-insensitive). If the gating ever drops or mis-points
// an edge, a scenario diverges and fails.
//
// raw_edge is populated for ALL files (not just changed ones), exactly as the
// task requires, so unchanged callers can re-resolve in the direction-1/2 paths.
// (Production's RAM-path full rebuild leaves raw_edge empty for unchanged files —
// an orthogonal pre-existing limitation that only affects genuine API-change
// incrementals, never the gated comment/body-only case where no caller is pulled
// in. The oracle isolates and proves the GATING logic itself.)

// ─── DELETE-STRATEGY PROBE: why is `DELETE FROM calls WHERE col IN $files` slow? ─
//
// p2_delete_calls measured 471s (OR form) / 394s (split single-column form) on a
// 2748-file resolve_set against a 4.44M-row calls table at kernel scale. This
// SELF-CONTAINED probe seeds a synthetic `calls` table with the REAL schema +
// the REAL idx_calls_in_file / idx_calls_out_file indexes, then times the
// candidate strategies on a realistic-size resolve_set so the planner's index
// decision (and the O(list × rows) pathology) is reproduced WITHOUT a 25-min
// kernel rebuild and WITHOUT depending on version-locked on-disk data:
//   (A) DELETE WHERE in_file IN $files            — the bare-IN form (suspect)
//   (B) per-file `DELETE WHERE in_file = $f` loop — the candidate fix (ops.rs:199)
//   (C) keyset id-scan WHERE in_file IN $files    — step-3's proven-fast pattern
// Rows/files are scaled by env (default 500k rows / 6000 files / 2748 resolve_set)
// to keep the probe under a minute while preserving the list×rows ratio.
//
// Run explicitly:
//   cargo test --release --lib delete_strategy_probe -- --ignored --nocapture
