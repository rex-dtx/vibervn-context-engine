//! Repo chat: a streaming, tool-calling agent that answers questions about a
//! single repository. It is **hard-locked** to exactly two tools —
//! `codebase-retrieval` and `file-retrieval` — both scoped to the repo the
//! conversation was opened for. The agent cannot reach any other repo or tool.
//!
//! Conversation state lives only in memory ([`ConversationStore`]), keyed by a
//! client-generated id. Closing the dialog drops the id; reopening makes a new
//! one. The store is LRU-capped (count + per-conversation message count) so RAM
//! stays bounded regardless of how many dialogs are opened over a session — and
//! only the plain-text transcript (user questions + assistant answers) is kept,
//! never the tool-call/result history.
