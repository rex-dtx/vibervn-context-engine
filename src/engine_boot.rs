//! Shared engine boot sequence.
//!
//! WHY this module exists: both the always-on HTTP server (`main.rs`) and the
//! self-contained `bench-query` CLI must boot the engine through the EXACT same
//! steps so they can never drift (same settings load, same data_dir/embeddings_dir
//! precedence, same RocksDB memory bounds, same stale-generation sweep, same
//! `IndexEngine::start`). Any divergence between the two boot paths would mean the
//! CLI exercises a different engine than production — defeating its purpose as a
//! real-index bench/query tool. So the entire boot block lives here ONCE.

///   (32 MiB × 2 = 64 MiB/DB) instead of up to 1 GiB/DB. This is the dominant
///   per-repo term; pinning it keeps total RAM bounded as repo count grows.
