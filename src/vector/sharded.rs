//! Per-repo sharded vector index with a resident-byte cap and repo-keyed LRU.
//!
//! Memory axis 2 fix: instead of one merged flat `Vec<f32>` holding every repo's
//! embeddings (resident for the lifetime of the process), the index is split into
//! one [`VectorIndex`] shard per repo. A resident-byte cap bounds total RAM; when
//! an insert/warm would exceed it, the least-recently-used **non-active** shards
//! are evicted (their `VectorIndex` dropped wholesale — no O(n) swap-remove scan).
//!
//! ## Concurrency contract (held by the engine)
//! - The whole `ShardedVectorIndex` lives behind a single `RwLock`. `search` takes
//!   a READ guard (concurrent searches run in parallel); mutation (`install_shard`,
//!   `apply_incremental`, `evict_*`, `remove_*`) takes a WRITE guard.
//! - `search` is `&self`: it bumps per-shard recency via an `AtomicU64` last-touched
//!   stamp (interior mutability), so updating LRU order does NOT require a write lock
//!   and never serializes the read-heavy hot path.
//! - Lock order is ALWAYS `repo_dbs` → `vector_index`, never nested the other way.
//! - Warm/eviction loads into a temp `VectorIndex` OUTSIDE any write lock, then
//!   installs the finished shard under a short write lock — the DB scan never
//!   happens while the write lock is held.
//!
//! ## Ranking correctness across shards
//! Every stored vector and every query vector is L2-normalized (see
//! [`VectorIndex::insert`] / [`VectorIndex::search`]), so each shard returns true
//! cosine scores in `[-1, 1]`. A global top-k over per-shard top-k candidates is
//! therefore exact — partitioning is mathematically transparent to ranking.
